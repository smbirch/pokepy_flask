# pokepy

## Now live at https://pokepy.smbirch.com !

This project utilizes the PokeAPI and SQLIte to implement a lightly featured Pokedex on the web! You can view stats about pokemon and add them to a team! You can remove Pokemon, make a team of random Pokemon, and more!

Pokepy_flask was originally a TUI app, which can be found under my "pokepy" repo, and was ported over to Flask.
